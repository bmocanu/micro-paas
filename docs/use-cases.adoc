== For users

=== The user can authenticate in the application

The user must authenticate in the application using the web interface, in order to be able to access
his/her account and any services provided by MicroPaas. The user authenticates with *email* and
*password*. For now, there is no password-reset functionality and also no email-validation functionality.

The user is not allowed to register new accounts. Instead, it is the job of the admin to configure the
user accounts and provide the email and the password to each user.
